# IPL Results Prediction
## Description
IPL-Results-Prediction is a basic machine learning project that uses different in-built models from the scikit-learn python library. It has two individual components: Match Outcome Prediction and Final Score Prediction.

Match Outcome Prediction is a classification problem that predicts the winning chance of one of the teams, whereas Final Score Prediction is a regression problem that calculate the final score of a team. Take a look at the jupyter notebooks for better understanding!

## Future Scope
For those interested to develop on top of this project, do consider this: Iterate through the entire dataset that's used for Final Score Prediction and pass each match teams and other details through the Match Outcome Prediction to get a seeding of sorts to get more accurate prediction. The other way may work as well.
